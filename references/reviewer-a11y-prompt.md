## Task

Review the implemented page for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. Check every item below.

### 1. Perceivable

#### 1.1 Text Alternatives
- [ ] All `<img>` have meaningful `alt` text (not empty unless decorative)
- [ ] Decorative images use `alt=""` or `role="presentation"`
- [ ] Icon-only buttons/links have `aria-label` or visually hidden text
- [ ] SVG elements have `<title>` or `aria-label`

#### 1.2 Time-based Media
- [ ] Videos have captions (if applicable)
- [ ] Audio has transcripts (if applicable)

#### 1.3 Adaptable
- [ ] Content is in a logical reading order in the DOM
- [ ] Semantic HTML used (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`)
- [ ] Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements (not just placeholder)
- [ ] Tables have `<th>` with `scope` attributes (if applicable)
- [ ] No content conveyed through CSS `::before`/`::after` that is essential

#### 1.4 Distinguishable
- [ ] Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text) and ≥ 3:1 (large text 18px+ / 14px+ bold)
- [ ] Non-text contrast ≥ 3:1 (buttons, inputs, icons against background)
- [ ] Text can be resized to 200% without loss of content
- [ ] No text in images (unless logo)
- [ ] Content reflows at 320px viewport width (no horizontal scrolling)

### 2. Operable

#### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
- [ ] All interactive elements reachable via Tab key
- [ ] Tab order follows visual layout (no `tabindex` > 0)
- [ ] No keyboard traps (can Tab into AND out of every component)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link present and functional
- [ ] Custom interactive elements have appropriate keyboard handlers

#### 2.2 Enough Time
- [ ] No auto-advancing content without pause/stop control
- [ ] Auto-playing media can be paused

#### 2.3 Seizures & Physical Reactions
- [ ] No flashing content (> 3 flashes per second)
- [ ] Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

#### 2.4 Navigable
- [ ] Page has descriptive `<title>`
- [ ] Focus order is logical and predictable
- [ ] Link text is descriptive (not "click here" or "read more" alone)
- [ ] Multiple ways to navigate (nav + footer links at minimum)
- [ ] Focus indicator is visible on all interactive elements (2px+ outline or equivalent)
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is correct (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)

#### 2.5 Input Modalities
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44×44px
- [ ] No functionality depends solely on complex gestures

### 3. Understandable

#### 3.1 Readable
- [ ] Page language declared: `<html lang="en">`
- [ ] Abbreviations expanded on first use (if applicable)

#### 3.2 Predictable
- [ ] No unexpected context changes on focus or input
- [ ] Navigation is consistent across pages

#### 3.3 Input Assistance
- [ ] Error messages identify the field and describe the error
- [ ] Required fields are indicated (not by color alone)
- [ ] Form validation provides suggestions for correction

### 4. Robust

#### 4.1 Compatible
- [ ] Valid HTML (no duplicate IDs)
- [ ] All `id` attributes are unique on the page
- [ ] ARIA attributes are valid and correctly applied
- [ ] `role` attributes match element behavior
- [ ] No ARIA attribute conflicts (e.g., `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable element)
